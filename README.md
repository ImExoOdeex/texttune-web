# **Text Tune website**

Hiii, this is a website for my discord bot **[Text Tune](https://top.gg/bot/1075428307409063988)**. It uses web streams API to defer bot stats to not delay the initial page load. Also I used `ChakraBaseProvider` to get faster page load. Site is quite heavy, since it uses Chakra-ui and 2 font families, but got .5s on `Time to interactive` on desktop lighthouse.

That's it! You are ready to experiment on your own!
